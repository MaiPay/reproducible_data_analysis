MICR 490 Project Prospectus
================

## Tatum Magill and Maia Payne

For our project, we aim to compile COVID-19 data from multiple
universities, or just our university, to predict whether the spring
semester will have more or less cases. This could take a variety of
avenues:

### Option 1:

Retrieve UTK COVID-19 data for students attending class fully face to
face this semester. Retrieve data for the COVID test positivity rate.
Determine how many classes are fully face to face for the spring
semester (assume full occupancy which will account for hybrid classes)
Make a model prediction for COVID positivity rates with and without that
population attending classes in person. Include confidence intervals.

### Option 2:

Retrieve COVID-19 testing data from multiple universities (either in
different regions of the US or within TN). Note the positivity rates and
trends throughout the datasets, especially the amount of students being
tested out of the total population that comes to campus (residential or
attending class in person) Create a confidence rating of whether a
schoolâ€™s dataset is accurate relative to other (more accurate) schools.
